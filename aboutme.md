### My History - How did I get here

To be honest Ive always been obsessed with being successful. Defining success is something that I struggled with. Sure having a lot of money, being high up in a job role, or being an expert in your feild can be seen as successful. Although I know there is something more. I wanted to define success on my own terms. This is how I see it. If I can learn how to code in python, that is success. If I can learn how to apply that code in python to use in mathematics, that is success. If I can take those things and begin to apply them to a career in Data Science, that is success. 

Believe it or not, ive accomplished all of that within the first 4 weeks at Lamabda School. So what is success to me then? Its having goals for the future and working towards them. At the same time find success in the process. 

My journey to just finding Data Science at Lambda School comes on the back of living 3 different lives in 18 months. Within that time working 4-5 very different jobs and moving 4,000+ miles in order to find myself where I am now. I believe very deeply in the phrase "Amor Fati - A love of ones fate" by Friedrich Neitsczhe. What that phrase means to me is that you have no control over your fate, only how you react to it. If you are going to react to something, it is best to fall in love with it. Embracing the things you cannot control is the best way to live life to the fullest. And man am I excited to see where life takes me.
